# Supabase Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your Supabase project and get the necessary credentials:

1.  **Sign up for Supabase:**
    *   Go to [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/) and sign up for a free account.

2.  **Create a New Project:**
    *   Once logged in, you should see a dashboard. Click on **"New project"**.
    *   **Organization:** Choose an existing organization or create a new one.
    *   **Project Name:** Give your project a name (e.g., `tinder-for-drive`).
    *   **Database Password:** Set a **strong database password**. **IMPORTANT: Save this password somewhere secure, as you will need it later!**
    *   **Region:** Choose a region closest to you for better performance.
    *   Click **"Create new project"**.

3.  **Wait for Project Creation:**
    *   Supabase will take a minute or two to provision your new project. Wait until it's fully ready.

4.  **Get Credentials:**
    *   Once your project is ready, navigate to **"Project Settings"** (usually represented by a gear icon ⚙️ in the left sidebar).
    *   Under "Configuration", click on **"API"**.
    *   On this page, you will find the credentials you need:
        *   **Project URL:** This is your `URL`. It will look something like `https://xxxxxx.supabase.co`. Copy this value.
        *   **Project API Keys:** Look for the `anon` (public) `key`. It's a long string. Copy this value.

**What you should have saved:**
*   Your **Database Password** (set in Step 2).
*   Your Supabase **Project URL**.
*   Your Supabase **`anon` (public) API key**.

Once you have these three pieces of information, please let me know.
